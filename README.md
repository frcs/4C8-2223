# EEU44C08/EEP55M08 22/23

4C8 is an introduction to the digital **signal processing**
algorithms that are at the core of **image and video compression**.

The course will cover the 2D Signal Processing concepts such as 2D
Convolution, 2D Z-Transforms and 2D Discrete Fourier Transforms and
Compression Algorithms for Images and Videos such as JPEG and MPEG2.

It is a fourth/fifth year module offered by the [Electronic & Electrical
Engineering](https://www.tcd.ie/eleceng/) department to the
undergraduate students of [Trinity College
Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie).
